            <h1>Greetings</h1>

            <p class="x3">About a month ago Isohunt team announced OpenBay open source project that allows everyone to create their own PirateBay.
We wanted it to be the future! The future where torrent community from all over the world is united into an unstoppable force.
The future where closing or blocking any torrent site can do nothing. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="text">
    <p class="x1">Results of this initiative were impressive. We have received plenty of feature requests while great amount of OpenBay copies
have been deployed. Dozens of minor pull requests have been submitted to OpenBay’s GitHub repository.
But every coin always has two sides.</p>

    <p class="x3">Every time when officials block websites community starts to сomplain and whine. Not many brave ones are ready
to invest their time and efforts to change the situation. </p>

    <p class="x2">We know that almost all of you are waiting for the TPB resurrection. But have you ever asked yourself
what are you waiting for? Why are you waiting for someone to create something for you?</p>

    <p class="x2">Remember how confused, scared and demoralized everybody was when THEY took down The Pirate Bay?
And as long as we wait for The Pirate Bay to return, the situation with blocking or taking our
favourite torrent sites down is still highly possible. That's why we will continue trying over
and over to create a system where it's possible to resurrect the site in a few clicks.
And we want it to be created by users and for users, thus to create a perfect torrent site.
We still want to change things for the better. We think that it's extremely important to keep that story alive. </p>
